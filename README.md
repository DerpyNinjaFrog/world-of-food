# World of Food
World of Food is a Minecraft mod that introduces a world of food to Minecraft.

The wiki page includes the recipes.

Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-of-food) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-of-food).

If you want more features, you should create an issue or discussion. You can also leave a comment on the CurseForge page.
Also, I plan on making a version of my mod with crops and maybe new cooking devices, as well as a mod that adds beverages.

If you want to make your own mod, I suggest starting from scratch using the [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod). [TechnoVision](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoVisionTV) and [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzPhyLcO8VP25dZ7kaUyAw) have some good tutorials for Fabric modding.

**Thanks for checking out my mod, I hope you enjoy!**
