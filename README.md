# World of Food
World of Food is a Minecraft mod that introduces a world of food to Minecraft.

Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-of-food) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-of-food).

While you technically can just sell copies of this mod, I would appreciate it if you didn't. This is mostly available for educational/personal purposes. If you want to make your own food mod, I would advise starting from scratch using the [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod). [TechnoVision](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3n-lKS-MYlunVtErgzSFZg) and [Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzPhyLcO8VP25dZ7kaUyAw) have some good tutorials for Fabric modding.
